## Ubuntu config scripts

These scripts will automatically configure Ubuntu with tools and things I prefer. It also sets up symlinks to all dotfiles

## Usage

Clone this repo and run `scripts/.bootstrap` then `scripts/.install` to install everything.

Check the scripts in `optional` and run them manually to install.
